# Economy-in-Data-Science

Welcome to the repository for my Economics in Data Science final project, where the focus is on generating a profit from 1,000,000$ in various investments, with a specific target on October 2024.

Key Features:
* Forecasting Algorithm: The primary objective is to design a robust algorithm capable of predicting stock prices, enhancing decision-making processes in the financial domain.
* Profit Analysis: The project includes an Excel sheet providing a detailed breakdown of the profits generated by various investments, aiding in understanding the returns on different ventures.
Investment Strategy:
In crafting my investment strategy, I prioritized risk mitigation and portfolio diversification. I opted for an equitable distribution of funds across real estate, banking, and stocks, striving to strike a balance between safety and profitability.
